# Messier Marathon Helper

A web-based tool to assist amateur astronomers in planning a "Messier Marathon"—the attempt to observe all 110 Messier objects in a single night.

## Features

- **Location-Based Calculations:** Automatically detects your location or allows manual entry (including city search) to calculate visibility customized for your observing site.
- **Real-time Visibility:** Displays a timeline of when specific Messier objects are visible from your location throughout the night.
- **Darkness Window:** Calculates and displays the window of astronomical twilight to ensure optimal viewing conditions.
- **Searchable Interface:** Search for locations by city name.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile devices.

## Usage

1.  **Grant Location Access:** Upon loading, the application will ask for permission to use your device's location. This provides the most accurate data for your current position.
2.  **Manual Location:** Alternatively, click "Show Manual Coordinates" or use the search bar to enter a specific city or latitude/longitude.
3.  **View Timeline:** The main panel displays the best times to observe various Messier objects based on their altitude and the darkness window.
